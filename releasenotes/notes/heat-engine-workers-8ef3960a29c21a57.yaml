    Previously the number of heat engine workers was set to $::os_service_default
    which would use the default from python. Usually this means it will use
    the number of processors in the system. We have found that this is not an
    ideal default for large number of cpu systems. We have a provided fact
    specific to heat engine named $::os_workers_heat_engine. We have changed
    the default value for the heat engine works to use this fact. This
    fact will cap the value at 24 but usually is the larger of
    (number of procs / 2) or 4.
